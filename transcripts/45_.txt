 hey wapking high resolution Mun am Barbie Ghoshal and Jayant Sinha with 25 masters of the design industry can learn from everything movie best companies wallpaper communicate in the. Design analysis everyday in this episode for singly reinforced beam design can you say never forgetting in psychology the episode where after the secret message from upper caste certificate design has impacted have you live now it's beginning to shape have Vivo you will IBM design thinking has given us a new Framework for theming for to creating without points on uses the talking is make decisions pastor and his keeping humans at the centre of everything we do sexy jawani thank you for having me so question I was wondering about the sign that prove that you don't think is going other sir call busy thinking about this and Chimney design is a bad teamwork I don't always think that I have used everyone as a designer stores are you crazy morning you cry but I think you know design can be done along came back at my own career there is no product no design actually produced or ships without dress designers others Ramdev so it something that I want to install in other designers and when I look at portfolios for interview someone is trying to get to you the core of that white holiday work with others how do I get to you have resolved because I don't think any create a product exist in isolation you do you do web designers can actually own an idea what do you think that it belongs to more than one person to get question I think some degree ID search Python infant Aqua images something so you get it out I think there is a partnership more about taking something good and making a better soaking time sleep building iterating and that's why you get over time ascent of ownership the you friendship you contribute to a great design and sometime just cancer patients are facing and and you forget about them sometime status mosquito bed to me that's the definition of ownership in indesign you are baby designer in ICU who has the graduate degree in Economics that is from which bank is this years back in 1999 the last 4 battery 1017-18 since October college ko macchli happier than become a pilot have BHL Bhopal @ I am there any like princess you wearing in that you tell time there is some about shape the way you cross design basic design HD 2016 that any background where does economics other anyone be on education Shaikh to you Rs designer I think I should things that influence me as a designer with my background will be interesting to think away in terms of monetary economics theories I like the man and supply what's interesting about that is a few good design forward people are going to one time and take over the last decade you seen where does apple in the hardware spray award IMO software tutorial expenses B we enjoy today at me that there is there something action to that and obviously you by saying images in college someone said if it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense so how does business really do whole thing I don't talk with me nn movie Sunny I come to pick up price itself number as actually product explainer price mixie fusion my loveprize Mini make you feel good because you're trying to sell your house and how is sleeping and Uber price and heavy duty price in expense of pricing of come to think of that User experience not use the number Sakshi master plan and how you communicate and design around the world we as an industry talk about minimum viable product why is there such a thing is economically viable this line I believe it is and should never hurts revenue stream for example why did that is back design cutting telling their their their LinkedIn sent that if you can complete a certain task business acquisition that makes design so important meal of the finger lock for is this design supporting the best case for the business nlb minimum is it not introducing friction or something that can complete the dinner date for buying something that is spending money when we have to be able to deliver the best way possible design comes in which we talk available effective communication in design so first question is the thing or industry does a good job communicating Bobby Deol the people and on design and I am in the second part 2 the question is Hari you communicate design to non designer to other people and their cancel the first part i c k y yeah I think we see in great improvement in how we communicate with the value of design in the last decade of so I think that being many companies and people who done a great job at the only Telugu stories but actually delivery trade expenses and go for the usual suspects Apple but also companies like Facebook in Google hasbi list of the updated design game is why I am searching for getting better and better at establishing design as as as requirement and communication is because of that and what are the things I I I learn hacking course in Economics Friday banquet think like that is selling and design Voice has a part 7 it is Mobikwik is Rio until it is you so there for you need to win the others that this is the best that this is the way. Turn off the lights with the stakeholders in getting them recently believe in the significance starts their players you have to make a view I have to become a really I want to become the reality can talk about you can communicated how I delete it starts in 10 line because otherwise has no no pudding in in in really in something that you can achieve talk about Siri focus on your selling design internally new Talking the people I might not understand but it is designers day what is what you are you working invest something they can do Kadam touch are you working in anthem vocalising in Idea getting them in from white poor to draw some stuff like you engage learning process what you do work a lot of companies that got the various designs why do I need to let selling of the function Cursed pressing however you will need to communicate ok keep it in this like magic box and and keep it and Monday say this is what going for a job I think there is communicating excitement about something and my BMI of a Dolly potato starch meaning caring how things work what it takes to get there and dose of different things so its recommendations we spectrum I mean as desired we want the you now animation the amazing graphics something looks that help you talking to an engineering back in engineering you want to make sure the 1 minute from where is this call coming from which point is this transition to tailoring it to the earlier absolutely you have to be force you to walk those Lines between because of you if you could a in amazingly design you can I get amazingly Titli back then not now what you want Taylor the message to the Aryans is something that I mean more sports 4 degrees is a good thing and we have to do a because if we eat if you do that and and up my mistakes myself and I have to visit are you sorry about that thousands of people watching this right now that I don't understand that selling is it is a component of the function of design in this web designers right we want to try to think about walking into the next meeting and not just presenting representing mechanics of writing why you want to leave it you wanna get people excited about this thing what are some steps taken take a think about Aryan to make sure that the theory the message and what is the medium of presentation will be should be thinking about other things we should be staying should I be focusing on the processor baby talking can a long term use bokeh next 6 months over hey you have start next weekend you can be avoided by what are the things we should be thinking about these things I'll come to realise that as design is essentially a story toys whatever you enter meeting you telling a story in Punjabi short story Cinderella story that story that has different ways of going through it's made and I think that's where the key is used or die was thinking about you as a story so as an introduction as a part I am getting above detail about it don't go titanoboa something I think you have to take keep along the journey and uneven that sound cannot really its role in reality because most focused located design of fresh innocent contacts and even if it is more famous in 2 minutes away as a story you start the Daemon mind for that how you going to tell a story 3 can just go in this is us screen and you rambling A1 screen for 10 minutes in infomaniac away I need to move on to the next page and inform you been in those design reviews that that turn into a bit of chaos and an advanced me and you cover to Prasanna why you asking want to cover so I think that's it for now I think you want this is ok for me and I don't have a steadfastly can you get some different X use Different techniques par query is important and hitting some some some point to you you want to hear and leaving a design review with some amount you now Assurance like ok this is water and unit for this is how we can I going to about this workstation are you are the story was terrible and easy starter what happened to another guy Tu Aashiqui starts with that and I am I so far too Frank become a better story Thora or Thora or Thora Thora are you doing anything to become focusing on perfection nice it's amazing the world we can create added to the letters and words arrange themselves and memory doing my time is clipboard we had really professional sports that had decorative experience in a magazine industry and how they think about creating an order ko Princess and the story online nested open my eyes 2 pingable kids stories but something that I am still working on this writing skill the disease that have her jacket design has impacted now it's beginning to shape have you worked with IBM design thinking has given us some new Framework for theming for to creating without points on uses the talking is make decisions pasta skipping humans at the centre of everything Wizard of Oz inspired by or Design Program which is over 60 years old but today IBM M4 is more than 1300 fashion designers and with certified more than 6 practices of IBM design thinking that themes voting more firstly whenever without client their uses and of Orders to create modern solutions stupid differentiated human centred outcomes rural with lock the share the story more closely with you and I hope to see you soon I want about IBM Studios worldwide wallpaper friends in invision today support invision is no bleeding for status and platform the future of digital design to the understanding of importance of collaboration to use my summer the most innovative companies in the world like Facebook Pawan Hindi in ethics 14 communication is what is the biggest planet have something to me you don't get feedback from others religion of then you can get lost in the words in that is bad for everyone we can be hard to show others your phone vision for design in vision solve solve that you can rapidly for a pipe at the front end of the design process in collaborator for every state of the project it simple 5 Virtually every aspect define virtual MX collaboration of Corporate of the process for everyone from Project managers to designer is developers and writers think that built the products of theories of Management using patients veedevadu typing in collaboration tools is the best way to go visit in patient after Khan in user access code IND dash high resolution for 3 months free delivery and then there is lot of it what's about you first we must look like any special about you. I coming into existing designing so you are taking over design Japanese saying sorry first thing you do is not necessarily diving into the pickle at the time to rest of the team composition also South Park matches in engineering to see even though the particles started what are some of the fing the working one working so 360 view of a one star wars then you will wanted Alvin and the main challenges of a small startup is that you really proposing changes that affect hungers is not caused without what are the products so that for me that as a design theme and design organisation Anita back together because we don't take care of prismo chaos in the class everything was really focus the design Chain and find n if a high impact project like this you want it team that we work work together National Insurance about Eagles for who owns what in that takes time coming in a someone new leading the team you need to build trust entire so sweet you for the first three months was a setting up a fastest border design team to be successful in to let them run in an organised manner to was also ensure the stakeholders and dad is mostly product and Engineering understood over trying to do weekly updates all those things you need to set up minimum nothing much feet is enough use bureaucratic which is Ocean earthquake we need to create space for designers do without you best which is amazing world and without visa process is is caring is a starting the engine make a switch is running sometime it's OK to be started but Keep keep the engine running and make sure your dinner aforementioned performed at some point is become the Chef umbrella for everyone there is no no PC way of saying it is really because of my job is to ensure that the thing can do what you wanna get the mix child but the problem head job in addition to dad is is also thought by product by engineering research on 10 may come for the process to be quick where are we going and eventually you need to become four venture India's first months are going to be answered Unicorn an aux wire gauze HTML link you take a few bad but it's it's Messi design is Messi if forget that is near between the resort should be cleaned by get there is a think every designer you talk to you can I have a different Spencer padagotti wedding card in inner product weekly update design focus anybody focus on that day Southern Goyal is important I don't like sending dark something like that great for documentation at some point every week video comfortably so Engineering Product design tattoo ever need to be there minimum and people properly so I was a group of 5 people maybe and down without food and the first three months is really design talking then you can I you like crazy but but I don't want saying like email me Honda can be important for organisation with for design like you need to the impression inithu inithu doctor documents in and slide down a saved all that saying sarcastic transistor about your relationship with him in his team how is the empowering design is affiliated product design Adobe creative work with Shivali give enough room for default design team to explore to come up with a design that speak to work over Isabel and animation Vihar and how is it within the brother want to create and he is very excited things which is refreshing to see he is not the script puppet show for instance you now he he want the map to come alive inside Google product Cisco iOS The Mechanic dual sim city in Russia preferably yes but does not come but it is dawai composed the envelope from the creative prospect from a design perspective to stop drinking that once you open the Uber app and you're trying to get a ride a if you like your in your city building and other people's life and Acetone for everything is it new things in so you cannot prescriptive necessarily nonspecific solution its it it is not get there really get reports and efficacy of enduring that's amazing walking to check I want the map via life in this workout anything doesn't get excited but that is really bad and and make it happen house inside the Sheep farms over which I think is it so I can say something something and let's people on the solution to it and yes we can have responsibility to hit to do that NH 66 speaking about the cross environment and travels system design theme after 3 months during a period time project was the weekend Uber app redesign so that was beautiful executed and I think something is really interesting too many listeners how does it catfish it a product without mode of transmission is special in first released before it was initially released in how we call the better experience nothing goes back to what I said will you set the stage in those first three months are you know you have executive support to today's so then it's really up to the design team and design leadership in journal to create environment where you can get to the level craftmanship more important you know it's not a design is open only write a call in sometime I tried table but an another girl we should do for that would a lot of that we had a design engineer on the theme who was a boat quickly test important things in Rio timer record using Uber API so that we can go out and see how it would be our presentation animation video what is awesome means watching closely web engineering team because they are the ones who Global and they get as excited as designers get a Batista to paint argue that some engineers a great design and ability to work with UK what if you from my career and here to Bittu they are quite a few that are amazing at understanding and work take it is next level my the work for few hours in Yelagiri check this out when I look at you may like this is amazing and it's that crossed where you just working today back in force that is it is critical in is no easy because I think many designs wood would would not agree that sometimes things get left on a table that animation we want it then have time for IT employee but I think it comes back to building excitement interest given during the redesign effort and the final stages Abracadabra reviewing a fine animation so that it comes in an enclosing shows a shortcut on screen and I really wanted in the following reason why was amazing is that I got fixed into the app two days before it share it and I did not have to argue for it a platform engineer get the job for me and Travels an amazing moment with you send me have an entire team in organisation that supports the title decision and I think as designers white Windows bridges is important because the next time something doesn't make it in Cinepolis and you should ask yourself why was that was there in the line of of ruan Thai Lee versus Juliet trade up is it going to get into the next release by how how do we do the same to sometimes you know after the first disappointment odiawap.in ever made in you I would like to ask a question ok next to next release how long is it gonna take what is the cheque Tippu singer and actress of well over Sidhu your engineer to do love it love it when there is a gradient in Engineering which is very important and useful about the bridges the design distance of Maruti Swift is the world's favourite vegetable productivity directory look like was design sitting next engineering work on this first required to disturb Timothy is everything sometimes you need to go when focus now long dress designers theme there is times we need to not be distracted maybe because you just trying to figure out your story is over story I don't have anything to show yet and step also their times we need to focus understand when you need to be available where you sit down with engineers and obc that hottest Kiya is the ratio of Internet in nearest is it want 25 may be wanted to know so everything which date is whistleblowing in internal website where we just started sharing over the design of all the motion for that Indus slowly start turning into a bit of a platform as resource for Forbes but you need to support everything you trying to achieve it is it now in after to say what is great motion study this is how engineers need to know ask you what's the what's the time in on this what's my busy if you want to be a technical like that. One second my next feasibility supernova is so now we need to add this I need to think beyond just doing the design itself especially when it matters at scale this is no vacancy time without an engineer everyday I want to go back to the hot pics back back to me is aware saying is not that engineers don't care Bharatanatyam junior stomach pain care I just like it it where to find available a collaboration around polish with me that that promise people with moral values and its part boys voice for the engineer properly found in inconceivable want something that everyone Din Ho horrible even why do you think grow that hot pics at the end of the day Aashiqui goes back to home without him paralytic indication and also education in the sense that I think you know we sometimes MVC want to see review about design Associates you open keyboard I still have amazing 1 MB and I think pura the process to happens only in a parcel I think we were able to do that excitement created where I became natural to have that and it was. In having so you switch around where is usually there is no we don't need that used people started saying like this missing something not right here and that's why you wanna get you everything time it takes it so it takes time I mean I remember elecon engineers started on day they need to get machine learning to at 4 weeks the app with white nothing frankly what is day They brought the entire app from scratch so literally their desperate I was a boxer like ok when I think they they went through that the space is true but it's really you know where we usually tend to think about something that doesn't need to be there this is Moiz solid something is missing and that's where design detector with AdSense without updating about baby's casual reinforcement is Sheldon Avid good design books like I am in beavers building how are they were the engineers rewriting the app from scratch as they work and up following layers of skin on the app it sounds like that engineer specifically probably solve the design theme held in vision and father daughter between were and was going to shop in the moment of pride became the poet said engineering engineering is not going making the score solid but it is not possible because Pak 2011 semi become the Manchester designer fighting for water but now I see everyone is fighting for us why not answering doesn't always successfully water vapour long as you can. tenderizing does matter I have a question answer it was broken internal website teachers staff why why why why internal and I just like an invasion something maybe we like to do things yourself never say that then It Breaks into Goa flights nursing Govt C200 fine ok and I remember telling the Project leader my dinner is gonna break I like this is not scalable frequent if you are trying to stabbers like big pieces in an and you trying to communicate and to be honest Google why does grey Tom and features are you name is that or or or Dropbox weather right there is something better today but at some point I was just use a way for us to communicate at scale and and I think it take difference pictures when you new something as fundamental as our our Rider experience you don't just like one thing you done you need to be able it says someone walks in the Goa tomorrow I do princess ok how do I do who are the various when we need someone to understand the decisions we made the component you can use your website start to poem Kurnool platform type design system website and and what I should one way of communication and there is many ways but don't think like that is most like that go and and monitor distributor we restore down as we need to communicate with more engineer can be considered as impression and beaten into the way to expose the system that you are working on which is it an idiot box at the same time with some have I always end up in a situation but it help because everything you do for life of respective is your info buy new bio products dangerous over the UK De parfum looks perfect use any updates in the runaways what happens but I think it is true about but so many things that the fastest sometimes happened by happy accident and you take the New York actually the reason define so what are all the resources 11 for employees have told that 5 minutes cancel saree design think prototyping is ki I mean mower mower we see that Khesari wife and say that there is typing on on a level that makes it quick in name is inversion principle and framework having Fox that know how to balance a design engineering talk about others people that can actually get production code into applications without designers it. I think that soon Roberts evolving but we would be able to make a project as quickly as we were written for research like that it is impossible just as much is Prema I love you when you get it to login to express it in code is not a ship JavaScript inside a native application at least now itself Dean Ambrose you even get closer to medal so speak is good but that that 130 I would recommend pic into it a desired to dive into Swift MBA the best within you ever but it becomes important you to do that is nothing is static and in what is there is showing an application to Boss vote to do finger without 15 changes action question paper solved question to you book fighting before we started reading this it's another call out of your experience just generally has a designer in wife has been through series of apprenticeship my one and distribute probly gave you are mental in your in your design career what are the things that you would have when you were a young I decided just waiting stranger things that are you will import to other people that I just really into the industry so was interesting search today working for Idea remember when I started I was born to be right this was so great there your of napping right so that how I behaved initially like this anniversary anniversary for 3 months like you should we should we should take back the quick watching critical wall for any negative feedback I would like by your head of family so I started to you quotation team opens with and and be ok with making mistake Exo not knowing something because if you don't know something you start learning more about it so in anything that something that was happens in my phone I wanna say you won't you get job in sometime that makes you overprotective so that something I came. Now with this is why I need to train my voice ok and you can do that sometimes it's hard to do we want to go and try few things that lies beneath your beautiful eyes when I can I get to the Bible also that that's a big want to me that was wonder things I need to burn to the feedback and economics back the bank at once why all the best trailer ever amazing in everything why so yeah it's there is need to become PO that the uncertainty and energy is game of Spain to start like natural parents parents shift uninstall my phone doing like that only. Used iphone so you need to be Anitha death to your environment to that source of design shape 16 time in accordance with the principal sir I think principal for every member constant at the end they are you think they can share birth of chef Damu our society lavoisier because if the eazy I mean if you think about it 10 years ago would you be a stranger to take a ride in car today that's no changes in outside even think is ok this is not ok and sometimes in some places that not ok and you know it is interesting that you see in a change is nothing design actually have the power to change some others but that there is something that yesterday control but I think that some principles remain fail account then you can look at this indicate the cow and some disaster design stuff dance and Birthday to shift over time by adaptability earthing and maybe related as 200 Embassy is something as desired we should be comparable and export so much you have never show this next to you is a questions we reached at river community ask them both burning in air Quikr few questions are we got from democracy every 10 hours to go out for this one for you explain the role of design the people in Uber shortly I don't have to do to me Datsun you still need to communicate and make sure that design frankly has datatable is ero you can play any products would like to get it to the next level 3D make it amazing and to get 1050 that necessary you should have celebrity designing note I'm getting sleep now me how it works have explosive in terms of user research has been denied since I been actually driving with Sabina doesn't understand the the flipside all is well but would I know what it's like to drive in Mumbai India no I have no idea I need please tell me what about V I need to go there Pinga Mobikwik contact like all the things that a design thinking do people from transfer get so I think it's up to us to make the visible to can tell stories again and again I given show the difference between something that was designed well and something that wasn't design wall anything we can see example that in in our daily lives in outside of the war it is my job and over to tell the story and to show evidence of the story to the evidences what makes or breaks it like a is a square fast period and your visa and he is the you know the data bind it make sense to to duplicate for design in company original fashion show this question speaking about the role citizen can take a how was the design organisational structure 220 V we have many things going on at same time wonder things I notice Pune join Uber is affordable luxury Verizon drivers not out actually it's it's more competition you live in our solar water lifting the engine bearing like pick you up seven super simple very complicated nmv know that people get pissed off when there is no time I want to drive jumps up but the whole it's like it orchestra that is in the shadows to to make it happen at 9:15 am I purchased it but the other finger realises that we are in 800 the city and the one thing that I think Mini Cooper is well and as desired we can limit that is Olympics that nmv column operations internet apps for short order food that make things happen in series they understand how does Siri works looks like this would have their eyes and ears on the ground and I think about it company that I have that type of knowledge and and and things that consists and you know we love with that so that's pretty passionate about you to take the interview cabin design for for that so how is a translate into the theme for tree you mention the rider you mention the driver for so we the branching and we have a talkative services does ola Uber sabaq tunicated how to make a female of the oldest English Fortuner Car Parking design team is being charging solution of know your voice writer driver eat Rush Hour delivery product in every saying since MCG side Marketplace there is there two sides of a coin to any product and then we have office leave or working on autonomous vehicles of SBT net infancy think about those things to you there is many different aspects what makes Uber take and what and how we make best for the future vs design theme for design team cover and most bass one of the most people like I would imagine most companies have that oppose not just buy the iPhone know we associate with iPhone or Facebook isn't just the better news feed how many people takes to build an amazing amazing microfarad to the people of the releasing this right now the only designer in the company may be just wanted to other people with them how would you get them to show the business the business are there in the value of what did us designers dinner what's amazing is a u value is actually immediate because you are the only designer by defective you you are the differences like it's it's really udemy designer at the start of Princess even free large everything is great word getting to the moment is 1 hour ago yes I remember reservation love meter is used by Idea designing step by step explain every month project in smart cities are any statue leopards different things you learn how to become more independent as a designer as design finger you you don't have to collaborate very well with product in engineering and problem directly working any product is the sole purpose is not for everyone and I think you know it takes I would recommend for someone just because you get some experience like you will recommend be the only designer plywood jeans price phone is successfully but but I think it's a different sounds really it's much -10 show in the sense that you are helping a company get to the product or even if you already launched in you are reaching open a failure and duper we have to make what if you trader and B balance this is a 44 amazingness with a sense of pragmatism and the trade of exist both in large and small companies but the balance to shift arasavilli and decision you make a different but as I will not come back have their causes and minuses and I've enjoyed watching in Bombay just represent a friend changes but I think if you are going to be really design small company making sure they understand by you is critical does it not to be free first wedding Prince sir new release work about terrorism as a way that all excitement project specific designer one static sign is there and people born in the next logical question is what is a girl in what is exhaustible open are the prettiest friend how designer job about the finding those do's and presenting I'm searching in this for my personal experience with Uber you purposely the product team you know you you look at the data you look at different exhibition around the design I get a snake venom bad company that is cephalometric driven samagra ask about it you can say ok show me new you proposing a changing is design and give a quick example in your experience uberpool to Uber black to SUV ocean on same page in scale right but it's ok be grateful is an interface for sure that the next procedure is like why do people get SUV life is it is not so looking at the data antipathy afternoon approximately what is trade off between not recorded the way also take into account if you're always wearing over black when I can do for you anything to me sector oneplus one section for uTorrent use data tracks recreate meaning for design and other duplicate Sholay goes the design course USB along with the business go to that you don't use unique a question would have to saying questions at some point enough is the young one of those goals is what makes a successful and you can get past like you know OK then when they see backup I don't like this design for why don't you like to join experiments working working a good Khesari new design is specially in a water organisation where you have to get back to Delhi I needed you so much I need to show why it is better there is something looking better Scorpio photo search something working better and used engine or Bing better or better its objective but what make money 14114 want to die question you spoke about the design should be underlined with those that makes complete sense how much the best way to like questions and affectionate you have they call it what happens in the Snare design alarm International Airport actually play that you can have trouble replay that I think design I mean it myself, nor destroyed by that's why you know you are you will explain you are fine and doing things but I think I would how would we do this then why going to Kisko netstat pension commutation but you know everything because you also something exercise like whenever you go out you talk to client I never never just think that they make decisions because this stupid business best hearing that Travels sir I want to be understand he knows this business like no other amazing understanding the MB name of the story is another responsible you have a Desire so if you go means that Business School big business call wife is a picture smaller one you can make Peda I am willing to forgot you present here to gain 5% there nothing to say we have some of that as well zamzam system fox are so frustrated Bappa pickup location in where's my driver in invited maps is am right there so we grow weed side to side of things likes make a shoe YouTube PS4 natural to get a down the phone on farmers if we do get a long does this people with attitude of you make so charging IC reballing are you better have a damn good story why you're proposing change it but you can adjust with can come to the table along with that I mean in your laptop I don't spend my day is doing to cook rice and standard error is expected at their analysis for the measures that that stood up to make sure this function correctly so your neighbor's question voice go back in reason why something quite is no reason we can we can end with this last question I am as the role and function design start save of water some ideas on methodology is or other rows using polymer of the next 5 years I think about this allowed pictures at times I get disappointed by the tool 7795 x images for shop never was beautiful shop I see some friends now that person I am blocked more graphic design skin around Shoppers Stop trying to figure out what's actually get a bad person have no interface not be heaven experience I think was disconnected because I really creating expenses of the day the message we use today are you the phone screen Saibo equipment me like this allows you to lift up and an MBA water drink from it and open my fingers but why but you know that is something like this please really it's pounds into it please your pic with your image of against my love is great but you know everything rounders and commodities market premium but I think it's how do we keep up with that and what are some of the things that changed speaking and science fiction some folks bread ready player one minute speech is used in S2 uses in a world that is not anymore I mean it policy review and I swear we are going at some point but what I mean no so you can think you can see reaction of Surveying Technology am going to hack someone I know that right now focus on iPhone Screen ABCD is better phone screen nothing I can shift so I think this is now like today in some meeting by wishing outside when I come back to the office in urine light crazy saying that they are asking what's next week but I phone 10 years today Sinha before that can I maintain my and take in array 10 years afeemi open Up Avicii and have a different type of interaction with technology with sliding like if we define autonomous vehicle you you remove the driver you remove a big part of the customer train what is the mean according to talk to you can a very nice bro by talking to you that that that Futura that that would be very interesting and I swear I would like to bring your expenses in January in a face expressions the expiry so continue repeating is absolutely nothing and everything is awesome wow you can really good place a good dinner I hope
