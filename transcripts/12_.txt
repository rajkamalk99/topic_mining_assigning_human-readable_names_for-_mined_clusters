 welcome everyone can I talk to the about not listening to users about sampling their experience 3 years ago I work I started working in Google search before that I was in in as Fortune I have used and we started getting more and more interested in what people want to know because it is on the video is what people actually do on Google cause it's a parody this is what people actually do we want to know what they want to know whether without connection to Google so I think came to me and we started planning this and since then had been doing study that we call internally then that stands for daily information means in this has been going on since then in the US and in other countries around the world with me pretty much ask or study participants is this question what did you want to know recently and we asked this question over and over again during a few days and we ask a lot of people at this question we will have the T-Shirts for the Din project hi my name is tomai Saranam Google search User experience Research and today we can talk about the message called experience sampling the problem I want to start and talk a few minutes about the problem that we have the problem is that people listen to uses what I call is to not listen to People's opinions or as many question about this would you something instead I thought for observing behaviour and I want to talk a little bit about why I don't listen to users because of what I know about the psychology the difference of the relationship between attitude and behaviour attitude is what people say they do and behaviour is what I actually do he was one study this was done in 1937 search event interview classrooms in our students would you cheat in exam and the answer a few weeks after that the back to the same students and together with the teachers table giving the students an opportunity to cheat without them knowing that that you are being tracked and spicy price the viscose 20 ko relation between with people said the future behaviour and their actual behaviour this was 1937 at 77 years ago he was something from 2012 researchers in the UK and this was done with this is a thousands of people in the UK went into public bathrooms in gas stations over the country in the US people coming out of the bathroom did you wash your hands after you finished your your business in 99% of people said yes however they also install the electronic recording devices inside the bathrooms and they actually counted how many people watched and again 32% of men and 64% of women really they watched another many reasons why this is happening lying is not one of them ok usually people are not intentionally lying about the behaviour which is very bad at projecting it now I want to take you into the startup world have been interviewing a lot of people in the startup world and what I found is this this is the main the main findings entrepreneurs have no time of budget is spent on learning from users this is what I what I observe in interview 250 startup founders and this is because I was so surprised by what I hear what I hear it from from startups in I also talk with me season I was even more depressed but I want to share the other primary findings from this from these interviews only 12% of them new what is User experience and I was very generous I ask them @ question in your opinion what is the definition of User experience in the give me the answer I was very generous in invalid in the responses and even after this generosity only 12% of them really need to find its very well another finding a Startup idea is born from a founders person open 86% of south of father's daughter start up because they had a problem ok now it's not my sister a bad thing it's finding it could be bad if not convinced that the entire world has this problem in many cases they are convinced that this is a I also ask what are the reasons that you studied your your startup this is what I have personal plane 86% and user research is down there with with 2% meaning that big is research to identify user needs and then they came up with an idea based on what the account in between spin of the story the company and then keep the door change it complete your study the new company based on what they did request from client. Came to them and ask them for something in the story the company or the red market research reports but the main resolve here is that it's only based on personal thing what I says that I used mostly for products or services that was ghost is zero percent of the people interview 212 problem problem to solve it started with this his company the did think about the problem before they started and you can clearly Universal acceptor headphone what's special about the topic from its for all the people who have a hard time reading agri achievement more than than just hot I'm reading they have big buttons here it's not the size of the phone but its not far from it it's really really big the letters are the fountain take this discovery of this can you think why why the doing this why are always special features what is the prior knowledge account for complete novices that they don't know they have no need of concept of modern smartphones yes WebView physical means with different with project and types of interfaces why I argue that there is for every new product there is prior knowledge SBI PO apply to using this new product what is the prime knowledge of elderly people in the use this that's a problem what is the knowledge push button and line I will go even further back this is the prior knowledge about compare these big fonts in does the spring how many view for elderly people use a smartphone like this you say that that's for reason that's the reason because it what is why it reach there the mouse in ear and this is what they eat it here this cover here this this grey colour here is to block the no is exactly executive done with this and other other features that just easier for people to use it's not based on Friday knowledge but its base on marriage day they don't have everything here is is yes no questions then type dial the phone number and then Aslam call Indore to yes no buttons so it's very kind of conversation also they don't need to understand if you remember the buttons back then send the end or figure out different different icons of icons and what they mean so this is placed on fundamental understanding a problem this of the questions app developers in startup founders as themselves it is a great questions with answers 97% ask you are my customer is 95% has a critical question to people need my product 99% as if the product is usable on earth and other questions this is the problem the way people answer the great great questions is extremely invalid in unreliable and I want to share some of these answers and some of the most funny because I will represent the answers I got in a150 interviews who are my customers the way the answer it is analytics and something personal they invent press inventive personas operation has the right based on nothing based on intuition Narang research analytics the their girlfriend graphics in this is how the in our who the customers are you people need my product again a critical question and Airways the answer it with research this is how the answer it in am not getting is the pro usable we focus on your ex you really really really really focus on your ex meaning that is good we use it ourselves is another answer we know if it is upon us who is the founder of the company is a product better than the competition after 10 minutes argument that they have no competition and you're saying that you have competition without knowing them they agree and answer with things can compare if we can compare compare feature list will look at the competition website MVC along with the features we compare two hours in then we know who is better is a product getting better we improve with all the time sorry and the people want the product which is by the way question I'm not really suggesting us because of people what doesn't really matter what matters is for TV and it's always different and like it here but this is what they do they ask friends and family members and friends and family members are very nice to you I want to succeed brother really buyers so that the problem all this means one thing that she is risk that the taking huge risk mechanic at right in the start of the power project that nobody nobody needs and the executing the wrong plan you you came here I know you never do that right budget in case you do I want to introduce you to experience sample experience sampling is what call the strategic research technique and its strategic because it's looking at uncovering user need it's not delivering a productive it is known that we currently have so in the Din project what we there is this vs people the same question over and over again what did you want to know recently and we saw this and I can share the date of birth and the size doesn't really represent the data but we have two parts of Avengers 1 is what people search on Google with the shared with us and there's another part of what people want to know that Google can give them today and these are two examples what do you want Google is pink like not just cause by Barack Obama height in Google is very good with thousands of types of f of questions of queries such as that but I also want to know for example what type of Rider my Google can keep the student today so all of this what people want to know that I can't do you do there is an opportunity for us and this is extremely indicative abhi Sony Xperia sampling is a research technique where you interrupt people's daily lives and ask them to know that's not their experience about something in our case was what did you want to know recently it's very good for identifying needs for understanding what features people need ok not comparing futureless to you competition and front covering current main points in the lights here is here the ingredients this is what would you need to do to run an experience sampling study and its not meeting at first you need to very carefully think about the question that you asking it's really really important again in R example we asked what do you want to know recent we also as this was the lead question we also add some more questions for example why because some answers viluntha not really telling a solid and then I give a few examples later SOF people for example if the picture better explain your answer take a picture send it to US and so on and so forth me after few other questions were you with other people who need a thing from me general speaking we plan each notification to take about 1 minute to answer not about up to one minute to answer this otherwise people so overwhelmed me answer question and ans of 5 8 times a day if it's a burden that there more participate now this question how many times do I ask them it depends on how many answers you want so any depends on the on the activity that you are looking after that you looking at so for example if it's what do you want to know recently I claim that people want to know hundreds maybe thousands of things during atypia we are only asked questions fibre 1 times but if it was the reason you recently updated your website that might not happen several times a day so I need to candles do some rivers mathematics and start with how many answers you want by the end of the study at say you won't 2500 answers in the and then you can start the fighting with say you have 100% and then you decide that ok I'm gonna send it to them five times a day for five days when you get to 2500 custom of the movie carbogen in in things you understand but this is how you calculate it switch user medium text messaging email in app phone message you can call them and ask them to your answer them to call you in leave a message If these are all valid ways the primary thing you need to you think about synod matches how are you going to collect the data because if its a text message that you don't need to copy and paste into spreadsheet that's not going to work with you thousand sponsorship thank you have a good way to do that an interview of poem with one question or something like that and then it goes into spreadsheet aur if you are more capable you can use it Hyderabad h n n think like that I think about it in advance don't find yourself copying and pasting 2000 responses we use sparkol Parkour is an app in Android app for sure not sure if there is NIOS vision yet another working on a road width and height public will be available pakau stands for personal analytics companion and also the name of the dog of the developer it's an app that allows us to send notifications in unmanaged assessment sample process releasing decide how to collect the data in spreadsheet or something like that now what is the prince and mention the hunt participants of participants in general Unity carefully think about participants and what you can do with them how many without the bird that Expectations there need to know what you expect you need to break them not too much you don't want to give some examples of answers because this way your owner can I get 20 examples stay away with with regards to what you want them to share or how you walk answer but do you explain that you expect them to answer each time and to answer of the questions that that you ask and answer the question in a way that will make you understand what they mean practice exercise before the study send the question once in NC what you get any other participants you are not really giving you what you want work with them on that give the main incentive and incentive at Google we pay but we have money to pay and I know a lot of small companies don't have the money to pay them I say in incentive is systole money if your startup small startup if you have an office greater a Wall Of Fame of people help us with research with their names on it take a picture and send it to them people love their name debussy a great incentive if you don't have have an office have a web page for that the Wall Of Fame of 30 participants who help us on your site them moment you thinking about research in general and experience sample specifically because it involves a lot of participants start recording them find them start finding them other ways to do that I'm not going to describe that now because its Take Me Away but start with reading your participants as soon as possible recruiting finding people to participate in research is the biggest political research let's talk about the analysis with talk about collect the data who we do it well then what you do with them stock available about analysis so we need to decide on categories that you can classify the data to imagine you getting 2000 responses did you something within what you do is classify them into different categories we have done in the daily information needs that we had 14 + categories before we even started with is fine with it real the specific what are the categories and what are the options in each category with say that pic and example so that's it this is your experience sample question what's frustrated you the last time grocery shopping so here are some categories location to be one category where the frustration to place in options might be too much easy your home way to from store in car parking lot in app store and other category will be closed people friends and family who might be informed spouse from my kids another one will be people at the store so good look at each response any classified by these categories Changanacherry how is the Titan 2nd so people at the store to be other customers here for service personnel install sophos and was the issue items understand it cost and long why this is just an example so what you do with it you classify each and every part that say this is one of the responses first aid is given in your recent grocery shopping experience and this is one answer is location combine with an elderly person who was in front of me on the line cosmic to be late to pick up my son from school write so hard you classify them show the location is Apple store close people are killed people at the store other customers in the cashier and the issue was won Vines Civic and disassemble each and every response which component as he do that you learn that your predefined categories are not so good sometimes you need to merge them sometime you need to put them sometimes you need to create new one sometime you need to get rid of you that's fine do that clean the data as you go dogs is an answer we got to the question what do you want to know recently we have no idea what does mean so so you need to clean this data this is a nice with you that the frustration at the grocery store question has nothing to do with what you need to clean that the inner and generate what she needs help yes yes then you can generate frequency charts based on your classification you can do reassembling the data in a meaningful way so you know what happened moves so maybe. Lions is the main problem maybe you need to do something about it and you see that your very quickly identify pains and what you need to do another way of doing that is what called eyeballing the data just reading responses Keep the alarm information understanding about what happened there this is an example this or responses to this question what was the reason you recently used a piece of paper to write something down and this is how you very quickly iBall the data into groups some people make a question paper writing ideas some people are sketching stuff you want to read more about this you know most nothing about the space sampling is this. this is more about it this is a private or Men the last guys there is a tedx speaker speaks about other things at 36 about floor with this is really good book to an list and explain sampling one second so experience sampling is virtual reality mining your mind the reality of your users it helps you fall in love with the problem critical solving a real problem that people care about and I know this is there distribute sandbox that's make at least one connection here if you real problem people care about I think it's very very helpful in terms of distribution so was that don't believe everything I say because I say I tried out on your own it's almost as easy as it sounds thank you
