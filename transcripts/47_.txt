You know product design you gotta represent an interview with you where you said you got it designing Fairy Queen and curtains I wanted you think most designers current designer because I buy shares Emma Stone and intensive I get into it and one of the one of them final such a sport and he got started here doing an internship what he was in real estate development course we have we have to sign a Miss you card and as as musician and then we have to do if you want to study Economics in school final seat in go to school at at home and 10 examples with joined us right out of high school and was

quotes and my dad is a professor I grew up in Columbus Ohio and so you know my mum really wanted me to get out and experience different things and then you know my dad had a water different connections to Ohio State University and to tell me connected to the people who were doing design and and was amazing about getting connected to design house like and for example there is a company in Columbus at the time and stitch I started as richardson's name changed its name to such he was one of the very early design consulting companies what is there if same SBI Omega zip drive funny an anecdote about the zip drive in the charges driver is that the we have been think behind the name is that their names that I am on my name is your dog Charles Dickens in the Universe in high school and I was lucky girl and spend a month maybe 6 weeks at sets and working well as a small group define despair and NIOS before reason is invented science and social equity so many people and end of stumbling into the growth of design and I think something this info forest Refineries design metres with morals is inertia relatable stories about about the field and help poor people become a where is radix American exciting applied for passport faux design gents bracelet I think it's a question you know your question makes me fingers and somebody who inspires me who I think is the great designer and office someone is created communicating design to a brother on I am in grad school in Seattle Washington I was lucky enough to meet a friend named movies wood and record quit it has an affair YouTube par for me and he started a program called in Iraq projectin and universe this program he wanted to bring design to the community and movies and his fight 6 ft 7 is a former professional basketball player and play football in Europe and an invitation CRA I didn't hear it for in rack project and I gotta see him a first and talking about design to a group of underprivileged middle school and universe AVI opening he was able to connect with students and talking about talking about Basketball talking about and sneakers you might be excited about the latest evidence you know you can actually assign the issues that the career that you can study industrial design and I want to college at the University of Cincinnati that is used with the school is known by I think 2009 point of that program is required internships for 35 year design course with a barrier and has internships and number of the people who I want to do science quiz want to do internship side Nike Adidas under armour companies like that and some reason designing designing sneakers and so you know I think that the the story the example of no is really important story 4 and 29b register keep in mind and in particular Kaushik CR how we can we keep away on internet talk to them on their own X voices using the lexicon of design that you know we all know but might not be a success support say when you were talking with saying with an even designers and industry doubtful you understand that gravity in an ENT specialist of the moment for design right now and I'm curious what money you need use the world special what exactly before in Trivandrum also curious about what bro you think design play some people life largest designers widespread in human beings life I am you know I think that we are living in a time that is a good American cheesy and industrial revolution of the 20th century and with when are developed many many products manufactured furnace used and when people realise that and this this product could be could be designed didn't have to emulate handcraft of the bus in school I was very fortunate lucky enough to BF open calendar ZTE the bauhaus screen design and then Germany caused by Mark and notification destiny Contessa and then you know why was the beautiful town and gasoline inventory exhaust give reason why the school there was to be close to industry to be close to manufacturing to be close to the technology of the time and jet engine manufacturing and they wanted to be there was the breakthrough Technologies so that they could you realise that is there designing things for people and I think that is we add that similar to the moment that we are in right now for Digital products and you know we depend on 20 products to get work done with up and down and spreadsheet and documents and calendars we depend on digital product apps to communicate and share with the people we love and attitude products are tired of the the fabric of our everyday life and suffix you are incoming started in design and reason for a design schools it's it's not always event that things like apps for product design universities heatsink app in App is a diminutive world is so small in so cute and unabsorbed and around for a while they must be figured out by and having worked at a place Facebook now for the top five and half years does a water stone its figuring out there is a what was the design and want to my favourite festival and her sisters and the journey 1% finished and I think that speaks to just how much work is yet to be done in the RAM of digital products exercise for this product and problem solving and not properly on enquiry five writers and their product design however when talking about design in Facebook and reason why do that is because the design theme here is a unique way position you take the products the people using every time and if it is fine here don't you that nobody nobody have a weekend on the final is to ensure reserve products paper easy for people and and that they help people solve your problems really beneficial and Ravi beautiful brother is quite homeshopping storytelling and procedure important for everybody alpha and because you know really so many people here are involved in making for the people and writing camp 5 Star Wars last because there is something that I expect the the four community FB par here you are working on products you are giving designer responsible for what they create everyone I mean we are now setting in a contentious political environment should be the most heated in my life time at the centre of it is Facebook the news feed the news feed Tanvi very very powerful and disseminating information by perhaps the office that primera the walls of Facebook and have been problematic I want to read designer Facebook think in a week 1 quiz is she is very seriously and the things for working out now in factor what people working on these challenges that I am going to Vipin working on for a while or sell we want to connect people with the stories the day finals meaning for me know the people care about getting information that accurate and I can give a specific example I am describe interesting and sometimes people share stories on Facebook and without having even read the article be sharing based on the title. and sometimes those types of shares are the types of shares that has an sensationalism organisation and you know as well I want something like that when walking to play on in area like this and we can factor that into how we design new speed because we have one used interconnect people with the nose meaning for in patient and we want an eye Facebook I want to create a global community of informed and physical engaged people wapking.in Forex that help people at my peace talk in the room 4 October Bose think available product is being inform you I hear your voice is saying people want to be more. my brother got the different variations Emporium information and false information is Dell information so you can to be informed what is fb during now to make sure that people are getting access to the right information server posting forest is a lot of work to wear during to remove and eliminate this on Facebook in this includes things like metal detection upfront as well Aspiring Westside 35 trackers suffered from that there is this question about and you know how how can somebody having more advanced understanding of finished you and I think interesting space to design within and we have learnt an interactive research shows that if you present somebody was an order call and that opposes body cover pages spread Lakshmi Dasan how.

given you national park on the same position singing when you pick something to focus on my speaking about administration family 24 December my usual suspect now like what you you should I tell something about that area is beautiful things one from where I was working on before and you know before joining Facebook I worked at ideal and one of the biggest things but I like that it was but it's great to try new things you never new Innova think you can a life so so so Bieber's new animes dear friend from messenger and I also like to view layout working Areas where define is a group The Innocent this was a new area and there was no theme any recipe created from scratch and that's what type of problem that I personally can be excited about me and the mission behind the work keeping people life is one guy that I find to be very very meaningful and and I think that is a WhatsApp Facebook and unique going to invite you to help humans in idea about the curious about relationship the word second second is not do this kind of thinking what should I say something I'm in UK my Facebook you came to the group thing I believe and bro that the time was observed when you will visit in Shimla Jacqueline strategy with girlfriend ideas Facebook was Sachin you can promote your because it is about the smallest written positioning in that is 10 interesting to reflect on and when coming to face but man united I don't know how have I would say then I would say and I also was I was looking and then one day received an email from from Mark Zuckerberg you now have enough the greatest one thing he read this book ok so I thought person on my phone and when the group more about what he was trying to accomplish in gatineau him mobile and joining Facebook as well as a single person to be something big I was turning as a product designer and I don't know what I want come in work and then if it's pretty in Kadapa and degree to which mark and doesn't understand the value of design that he will call upon the phone Enna Vendum designer who might be interested in in coming to Facebook I came and I started engineering bootcamp and those that end in fact I can never brought out interested away from engineering to tell you know that you have some things that simply clever problem how can we are the time we had just announced timeline we had Japan and some changes the news feed we're just announced the product code checker to design theme with me 3000 people and then I was wondering 52 week for 3000 people and make it always listen to the biggest conference room in the building and then I just want to develop my sweet son help with me is different challenges and how can we make a product like that I would prefer people and how can we modify critique Savdhaan work at the scale of measurement in time and so I just can't get started working on things that happened and my very first artist wapking we say anything quite group and be designed into the small feature for Facebook with anybody received first payment Oracle and which is the Singh on Facebook just few months ago we will miss the feature on Instagram and maybe about six months in Facebook I was interested in shifting to become a manager and when talking about this and their progress team stood out as an area that I was interested in that I was interested in the great theme because I will Android there

some of the challenges the people around processing as they try to use Facebook challenges like are you now EP like to be kind or sign up for Facebook to be required having email invited to sign up for Facebook and then I have done I know what you doing Siwan so I I survive in the word from the one talk probably 1 hour and you know remaining on my my biggest take away from from Idea sign you in different things I said I am interested in crore what's current window 10 out for the kids design has impacted have us now it's beginning to shape how we work cute IBM design thinking has given us a

Virtually every aspect of the MX collaboration OK what are the positive even integer is the designer is developers Android think that the Furious management using patients sweet of prototyping in collaboration the best way to get everyone for visit in vision have taken for high resolution 3 months rate so much Quickstart you in 2011 this is before the IPL which means he was busy use voluntary search for product designer salary of why is there no you very senior you know I think that I am not reaching out is is is a reflection of us how much is all yours design and I think one of the top priorities for Facebook in 2011 2012 was and scaling the design theme and creating a very strong define condition to support the feature scaling Facebook and when I was in piano in Christ School at DUB University of Washington and my mind games was trying different really design classes and one of those maybe to I had a backup of students who were particular Wanted Wanted when was the get hired by Facebook in dropout of school and its pink third corner coding-compliant with proper living habitat Punjab and perimeter in internship and then he started working at Facebook after after school and Visa appointment time where the Facebook design team is very small bike SRS media doesn't people and I am very high tech Nicobar for University part 2 expected to design biotherapy production open engineering and this individual true and he have to open up Facebook and broad in Facebook definition of design that started the following fruit counter design with venue and hip open 123 he have to phone me so I think there is another part of the the the story writer I mean it's funny because I think that speak to you and something went to meet you Facebook and Facebook is all about IPO connecting about communication and I am is the weather so many things get and you know what it not for an abroad Communication Technology true and I never would have connected in the water that connects here that's not a type of thing that one is likely to achieve 21 in a working on job application to learn something like that the colour of the Moon around ok so coming back to your journey to the group in Facebook on that was arranged in commercial circular story new concepts what was some new things to create responsive design process problems and stupid things one is that I am I want a wife at in your everyday is on the great thing about designing for people who I like you and adventure examples somebody and finding app for Facebook for the first time on the phone without having having an email addresses and having her if an email address what is there and after period missing experience that's that's what I will do that Idea as well but and I can get much deeper into it and in the context of a girl Facebook in Facebook school boy PDF inside and you telling in he would you take away from my relatives on girl and I know there is an another name for data in designing products today enjoy the finding for somebody who is really not like you. You know what work and so we can use data in water Shiv understand new is this will be working for somebody is there making it simple present to sign up in confirm new account on Facebook and open it may be a good idea young and those were running have informed and all of the work that I done subsequently I think that data is one of the the best quotes for a designer yesterday anything special that enables us to understand the products for making really working for people what are some things I should keep in mind thinking about offline Sridevi passes and how to the active function if you want to turn around and try tomorrow and one of the best prices and you have I am as you are thinking about that and what might be it's great to talk to people to do user research to get maybe a descriptive analysis about how the just working for people said I have to spend some time to just understand I am really really understand the area the you working and sometimes option in the data can help you to identify a special opportunity for indesign so I didn't reach designers just started really thinking about data and you said as there is there identifying where is a define opportunities my PC open and the data in a bizarre step by step more info record in understanding work so I am don't be too attached to the thing you making and give you don't know necessarily whether it can work or not ok it's ok. Of the prices and last pic I think it's great for a designer visit you and to learn about data and going to know about it to you and to be able to you and asking questions about it to be able to 25 and the date of IPCC May be the season actually activator maybe and may be the season 2 date of the notice period something Dolphin browser mango how many how many years months we want a good thing I am I work directly on growing Facebook for baby couple yeah, yeah ok so Jayega expenses goes on and your dog when you put in charge messenger from my understanding is are right you you are the design on maturity Mein YouTube open design theme for messenger and how is it different how was it she teams operating Praveen Amboli bring from growth tenacity and to messenger visibly exciting opportunity and it is exciting because and Kapoor different brands coming together and one thread was that one of the diviners @ wanted to find out who is working with me on growth of the time and Mrs interested in messenger and and wise thinking about son of the problems in messenger with Dinosaurs and how they were inhibited by dozing messaging within the name Facebook app and so he started thinking and I am putting together with son Sun design sun sun accessory sophisticated analysis and that should would could be right to you haven't dedicated in standalone messenger app and not connected Sun applied on a strategic and understanding at at the time and as well as you get a sentence on word for people and in a messaging and everything so I think like you not getting me fast responses from the people who your message so beautiful we are composed strategic thought on understanding the farmers are thinking and designing and the imagining what this product can be like me and myself any number ki post extra attention from scrolling Facebook who are Id and this different tiffin opportunity different problems space messenger and actually we wear.

well and you know one thing that has worked I think quite well I FB is that me and don't have a program inspired by engineering to camp vicho engineering girls when I get started here are the because the fine and define camp is something that if you're studying at Facebook ads in refinery you would go to define campfire of risk oblique and that is a train and time where we can describe the contacts of this but we can I help you to an ad Hudson a technique that my Sachu of Physics we can explain our design philosophy interview exposure to different design tools and surface and as a team is growing quickly and you can reach a huge ocean of the define community by focusing on new people also coming and saying that and has helped us the square that was in the people space between inner product space is Bhoomika take the Facebook interface guidelines and Singh is something that started and several years back and and we wanted to create something that was actually to the weather Facebook work and why Facebook works is in a water different people different groups were brought about and amino parktown President and CEO so sweet and sour about to create and components and pin code that designers and product themes could produce and effecting was that is your friend designer and father came to crack the speed of component that has a whole bunch of things figured out when would be telling something from scratch and that would enable us to focus on identifying what are the unique problems within itself inverter working on and put the majority of their design attention what does unique problems rather is end preparing their energy crossed every aspect of the define mention the world something exam curious an interesting example of that is an Internet not working internet is really admission very exciting cleaning people online and it it's amazing and and I was taken aback when when marks and lets do this it seems so big and nothing area say everything Apple theme from scratch it's an exciting problem if something is very meaningful and and I got something that instead of saying you know I want to know what my sweet Singh cannonball tonight I said you know and do what other people on my name the five equal opportunity for you and depth of that and incredibly find him that's ok stand internet.org and is doing really amazing work that's it now Austin seen by Casio in California meeting with any other members of people in this week what is the expect you replying to those meaning what are the sink sizes and that resonates with me deeply is that time you should bring your whole stuff to work and I am seeing myself to working that includes the part of me that's the designer and and so you know and mortar ratio can expect me to bring a design process September on a given topic how we can craft something better how we can make something with better for people and but but other aspects do I have open the next I am perfect person I like to I like to listen and take a lot of things then and then and then can summarise back to people and I'm an introvert when we have we have poster surrounded say in AMU fast I can if you like and dislike and so you in my contact I bring my host of which include Aaj Tak samachar nearby designer today is an if Pakistan shaping product making saying the people and it is really interesting and exhibition right now in Canada by Japan that is about the line between and design and I think the difference between craft and design is is inside the scale you know when you decide something you are deciding it to be used by many people many people and you know the difference between design and craft is typically the YouTube and earn more people than just yourself to make something and and and designer suit making things where you need help from others to naked and you you hope that people want just you will be able to use it and I really like this can provide ka gana practical definitions of design invertis University and leave that things like storytelling in problem solving and PCR important aspects of design ok that fundamental with us check the products people thinking out virtual reality 1005 arm and a becoming about my future do you think we're going to come to think of this means that humans and whatever your opinion is around how do you think that why this accident reason for you know it is and when we might status thinkers technology and in the way the missing that human and if we do here is the people at the centre of everything will be do and what does it mean that Technology isn't an important and it makes me think as a I am a few months back when our head of sound design I came up to me and he said he will I am what is coming securities saying and so I could on the Octopus headset unprecedented Kickass ok now now try this version and they will give me a different heads up my call and put the SIM card but you was much much more life like you was totally different it's like and as I turn my head you know I can hear the engine behind me and difference was that I am there a special area in the second present rather than the first and the music Excel me and we will be announced in very less I yesterday so that people can I am in corporate special area into their Alberto Del Rio 360° and showcases the way that Technology move on there are always different breakfast breakfast or an alien fighting for us designers because they they provide us with new opportunities pricing Kareena example of the service that people at the centre because that all about making the experience for the the actor much more realistic and my friend request I was five and half years hear your entire body of work we think of how much you personally ground their properties and the product is I have you started the personal Facebook URL 5 years latest design of Facebook in a product designer designer One Rank was his journey book with the skills that look emphasized that brought him interposition to be able to manage this pick them in all this fundamentally different people connected some other skills and and and and geography are you know I said to be a company like Facebook like I am pic of Drake Fortune head for those opportunities the brain front of me I think that there are two different things that help and one thing that help is an feeling otherwise first and this is an Ocean that can be an odd business school at professor Adam grant write about man from time to time conversion there are people work Every Step I Take people matters and you know when I came to Facebook I just tried to give as much as I could and do what is right for all the people who are using the product you was right for Facebook and do it right for 25 minutes expert and for myself at the bottom of the west and and I think that the focus on what's best for the community of people who uses pocket purse for the company I think that those are the values and attitudes that help me to get Reliance today responsibility is designer should be paying attention to try that let me be there ignoring today on detriment the correctly help them in surveying companies help in growth and Furious Swami Samarth Gayatri I had use of the most important skill sets for designer is true and understand the contacts with their operating with you now and what a given companies doubt user understand whether companies training understand but the company is all about and if you can do that then you can find all the work doing as a designer in the Western and in language for everybody can understand and I think that sometimes to finalize an end up stuck in the world of design and and duty free into you know some particular part of the define not working when I was having dinner with ABC a few years back and then he said something that time recent satellite sharpen the refinery can and that are focused in a group and their portfolio 20 then and I am really going to add B.Ed important contribution understand my excuse meaning questions and we ask boy married to the mouth with burning Up Inside them in the given five questions of the you doing designer design business and I think it is best for designers and focus on explaining the role of design through concrete example the best example wolkem from which organisation that your voice so and if you want to and showcase from abroad we communicate the value of defined in your organisation I think you should I gente I may be a civil case for design and a a time where to find really made a difference for something that matters to the company and make sure that all that story you know we improve the registration experience for people on Facebook animated much easier for people to confirm your accounts and now many more people on Facebook because we made it easier and and type a hero RK serial example it was the president is no question about the value of this and it's it's it's always there and you might have that you ok ready thank you just need to communicated and frame made in a wire if you just getting started and you don't have that your case in a workout for what time it is going question is how was your day going female Facebook login I am the way the be organised production Facebook is we have WhatsApp small things and eat small thing has and have a lot of autonomy and responsible pay for the area that work on Facebook is an pink company and high growth company and you may find yourself here working with him for the engineering may be one of the Indian viner 151 product manager and you may find yourself in a very small group at my dear award like a stray dog but going on top of the Facebook platform in Facebook infrastructure astrodatabank from scratch in the market and so that's why we have we organised and we sink is there has been a few different colours of product development and these include product design Tera engineering and product management and there is also a tweet about the teams and discipline that time are involved in shaping product like content strategy Ramdev research product marketing at cetera socks for a given initial if we try to assemble a team a great team of small thing that can an internal Eyes the purpose of the work, that I knew it is very interesting sir I am the question is when you're the only designer in a company you are far cry from where I get it better when you're the only designer how do you convince the leadership in a company of the value that design dreams in the only designer in a company is the unique situation I get the unique gift Pisces and it also another opportunity because there is lot of integral from one I think how to convince people of the value of design is kinetic beyond the
