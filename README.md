# topic_mining_assigning_human-readable_names_for-_mined_clusters

In this project I'm basically extracting the audio from the video files and then fetched the text transcriptions for those audio files and used a unsupervised clustering methods for mining the different topics in those transcriptions. After mining the clusters(topics) I've assigned some human-readable names to those clusters by using tf-idf technique.
